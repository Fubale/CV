##Reserch

I am interested in Side Channel Attack and distributed system, For me who just stepped into this field, inferring passwords through current leakage model seems like magic, while distributed system is the inevitable development direction of the Internet in the future. For this, I am very grateful for the introduction to Cyberspace Security, which opens the door for me.
